# Get-LDAPS
Script to Create/Renew LDAPS certificate with a domain Certificate Authority. Also allows for checking the expiry date on the current certificate and generate a new one if within the defined parameters

Technically this could be used to create/renew any service certificate with a small amount of tweaking. (I've actually done that, but I haven't had the chance to go over it and upload it as a separte script)
